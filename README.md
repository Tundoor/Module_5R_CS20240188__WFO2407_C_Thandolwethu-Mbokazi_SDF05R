# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

I was given a challenge to style and create my own buttons. I was successfully able to do so and truly enjoyed this project.

Some challenges I faced:
*Getting certain animations to work: Some design styles I wanted to create I was unable to do as I could not get the animation or transition to work.
*I struggled asswell with figuring out timing function but after alot of trial and error I was able to successfully learn how to get the timing right.

My design choices.
 *Alot of the choices I made was based off what i felt complimented the animation that I creared. Overall I'm extremely happy with the design choices that I have made.

Features I'm particularly proud of:
 *As of currently I'm extremely proud of all the features i've designed but the one I particularly am fond of is the style I created for button three and two. I was able to make the button glow at the border and the other one I was able to make spin and I'm extremely proud of myself for being able to recreate what I had envisioned.

This challenge was one that I truly enjoyed.
